# exoPlanet_visualization
A Python based tool for visualizing transit curves of exoplanets and eclipsing binary star systems.

### Intended audience
Citizen scientists who would like to understand what causes features of transit curves, for example those involved with PlanetHunters NGTS.

### Using the tool

The GUI is launched using the command: "python3 exoTransit_visualization.py". There are five planetary system model parameters that are user-defined within the GUI. The model allows specifying a limb-darkening factor that is applied to the primary star and a binary companion star. 

Detailed instructions can be found in ExoTransit_Visualization_Guide.pdf. The guide  includes screen shots of run results of planet transits and binary star eclipses, and technical details about how the transit curves are modeled. 

### Requirements
Users need to have Python3, matplotlib and numpy installed.
